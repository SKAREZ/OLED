# ðŸ˜Ž What's OLED?

**OLED is a simple resource pack that only does one single thing, changing the color of the Minecraft UI, making it oled dark.**
OLED aslo change the font of the game, to make it less blocky and more smoother, thanks to [VanillaTweaks](https://vanillatweaks.net) for this!

- *You don't necessarily need to have OptiFine for using OLED.*
- *If you want to play Minecraft having OLED and another rescource pack, be sure to place OLED on top of all resources packs enabled.*
- *OLED is still a work-in-progress resource pack*
